                                                        <p>In the past five years, I have also served as a Business Development Leader, transforming individuals by helping them reconnect with their purpose and reigniting the dormant drive and passion they once had.</p>
                                                        <p>I believe that unlocking the unique expression and genius within every man is possible. At Radical Responsibility Coaching, we inspire men to envision new possibilities, take on significant challenges, and create an impact that extends far beyond themselves.</p>

Ron reminds me that I need to stay focused on my goals. I am generally a positive person, but sometimes my mind will not play nice. With his help, I know I am strong enough to take control of those thoughts. Each conversation, I know I am not alone in this world, and that gives me the strength to keep moving. Ron provides a safe space, he is easy to talk to, and he listens to every word I say. He has provided me with the tools I need to keep moving forward and has offered suggestions and advice without judgement. Every day is unique but being able to feel the sun on my face, instead of the rain, puts a smile on my face.&#8221;

Following a toxic relationship and tough divorce, he has helped me discover in myself how to understand, combat, and control my depression and anxiety without having to rely on medications. With his help and methods, I learned to accept my responsibility and take account for my actions as well as how to move forward and not dwell on a past I can’t control while focusing on a future that I can. Today, he is helping me navigate my way through college as I gain my identity back as well as my self-esteem and confidence. I honestly don&#8217;t know where I would be today without his help and guidance. Ron has been an amazing coach, friend, and confidant.&#8221;

Ron helped me take full accountability for my actions and behaviors, and that shift made all the difference. His coaching pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and finally take control of my future. Thanks to Ron&#8217;s guidance, I no longer make excuses—I own my choices and my success. I’m proud to say that I’ve launched my business, and I owe so much of that to Ron’s incredible coaching.&#8221;
